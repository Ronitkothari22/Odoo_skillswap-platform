# Skill Swap Platform

## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement
The **Skill Swap Platform** is a peer-to-peer application that treats _knowledge as a currency_. Users list skills they can teach, discover others with complementary interests, and arrange mutually beneficial swaps â€” all without money.

Key requirements:
- Create profiles with name, optional location, and profile photo.
- List **skills offered** and **skills wanted**.
- Specify availability (e.g., weekends, evenings).
- Make profile **public** or **private**.
- Search/browse users by skill keywords (e.g., "Photoshop", "Excel").
- Send swap requests, accept/reject, or withdraw pending ones.
- Track current & pending swaps; leave ratings/feedback after completion.
- Admin tools to moderate listings, ban users, monitor swaps, broadcast messages, and export reports.
